The combination of rising claims, shrinking coverage availability, and infrastructure vulnerability is increasing costs for households and businesses and forcing shifts in risk management and capital allocation.\n\nWhy it matters: escalating insured and uninsured losses can compress insurer profitability, raise premiums, reduce home sales and consumer confidence, and force businesses (notably data centers, logistics and utilities) to invest in resilience or face higher operating costs and outage risk. This creates demand and cost pressures across sectors (infrastructure, cloud/data centers, consumer goods, waste/logistics) and can have broad regional economic impacts.",

The company\u2019s ereaders have dominated this space since the original Kindle came out 17 years ago, but in this case, it feels like Amazon is playing catch-up. Color E Ink displays aren\u2019t novel: we\u2019ve tested and reviewed a number of color <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html\">ereaders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a> from Kobo, Boox and reMarkable in recent years. But Amazon is essentially trying to pull an Apple with the Colorsoft: with claims that color E Ink technology just wasn\u2019t good enough to put into a Kindle until now, Amazon\u2019s promising the Colorsoft gets this implementation right thanks in part to the custom tweaks it made to the display. And, unsurprisingly, Amazon\u2019s ready to charge you a premium for it. So is it all it\u2019s cracked up to be? As you might suspect, the answer isn\u2019t as simple as yes or no.</p> \n<p><strong>Update 1/16/25: </strong>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286289/kindle-colorsoft-yellow-bar-display-e-reader\">multiple reports</a> of Kindle Colorsoft owners seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader\u2019s display (myself included), I reached out to Amazon to receive a new review unit. I did so after the company stated publicly that it would make \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-will-fix-the-kindle-colorsofts-yellow-display-discoloration-190143346.html\">appropriate adjustments</a>\u201d to resolve the issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Amazon sent me a second Colorsoft review unit at the end of 2024 and, in short, the new one did not have the yellow-band issue and the display appeared warmer overall. An Amazon spokesperson told me that a combination of \u201csoftware and display adjustments\u201d was implemented to fix the yellow-band issue, and those are the only differences between my original review unit\u2019s display and that of the new one.</p> \n<p>The difference in warmth between the Kobo Libra Colour\u2019s screen and the Kindle Colorsoft\u2019s screen was dramatically reduced on my second review unit. That\u2019s a good thing for the Colorsoft because its screen now better mimics the look of actual, physical book pages. I've adjusted our pros and cons list to reflect my experience with the new review unit, and what follows is our original review.</p> \n<p><strong>Update 11/5/24: </strong>There have been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286289/kindle-colorsoft-yellow-bar-display-e-reader\">multiple reports</a> of Kindle Colorsoft owners seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader\u2019s display. My review unit was not affected during the time I spent testing the Colorsoft, but upon checking on the morning of November 4, 2024, it appeared for me, too. Upon reaching out to Amazon for comment, a spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously \u2014 customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we\u2019re making the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-will-fix-the-kindle-colorsofts-yellow-display-discoloration-190143346.html\">appropriate adjustments</a> to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\" In the meantime, we've removed our score and recommended labeling until we're able to get a replacement Colorsoft and test it for a longer period of time to ensure this issue has been fully resolved.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-screen-technology-and-comparisons\">Screen technology and comparisons</h2> \n<p>Let\u2019s get the tech details squared away first. The Kindle Colorsoft\u2019s seven-inch screen is based on <a href=\"https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido3\">E Ink Kaleido 3</a> technology, but a representative from the Kindle team explained to me that they developed a custom display stack for this device. That means they made quite a few changes to the tech in order to achieve things like higher-contrast pigments and improved speeds overall. The Colorsoft\u2019s custom oxide backplane uses 24 driving volts to move pigments around more quickly and it helps those pigments appear with better contrast. Nitride LEDs enhance colors and brightness, and a custom coating in between the display\u2019s layers helps focus light through each pigment so there\u2019s less color mixing. Some of the same tech helps make page-turns quicker and supposedly reduces excessively noticeable screen refreshing when you go from one color page to another, or pinch-and-zoom on an image.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>That\u2019s all to say that Amazon would like you to believe that this E Ink Kaleido 3 screen is not like the other girls in this space, and while I do not doubt the Kindle team\u2019s efforts, the differences are not as dramatic as the story would suggest. Until Kobo updates the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kobos-new-260-sage-e-reader-lets-you-take-notes-110559289.html\">Sage</a> with color, the closest competitor to the $280 Kindle Colorsoft is the $220 Kobo Libra Colour (in size, platform and overall experience), so I did a lot of side-by-side comparisons of the two.</p> \n<p>The biggest difference I saw was that the Kobo\u2019s screen skews warmer than the Kindle\u2019s; I kicked the brightness up to the maximum and turned all warm/natural light settings down to zero on both devices and the difference was noticeable, regardless of if the displays were showing color images, black-and-white text or a mix of the two. This would suggest that the Kindle will show more accurate colors more often since there\u2019s less of a warm lean to its display.</p> \n<p>But on the flip side, the Kindle screen\u2019s blue tint was just as noticeable, particularly in low-light situations (like a dark office or a dimly lit living room). At max brightness with warmth down to zero, the Kindle\u2019s screen was borderline uncomfortable to read in those environments \u2014 but all it took was a slight adjustment to warmth level four (out of 24) to get it to match the Kobo\u2019s display in warmth almost exactly (at least to my eyes). That made it more comfortable to stare at in dark spaces. I also compared the Colorsoft\u2019s screen to my personal Kindle Paperwhite (previous generation) and the blue skew was noticeable there too.</p>  \n<p>Ultimately, how much warm or cool light you prefer while reading is up to personal taste. My preferences would lead me to adjust the warmth on the Kindle to be a bit higher than zero, mimicking that of the Kobo. In an unscientific poll of the Engadget staff, both in person and with device photos, everybody preferred the screen on the Kobo. I think the slight added warmth in Kobo\u2019s screen makes colors appear a bit more saturated and more inviting overall. It also gets close to mimicking the look of actual physical pages (as much as one of these devices could, at least), and that\u2019s the experience I\u2019m going for when I read pretty much anything. But I could understand why some hardcore comic fans would want to start off with the most color-accurate baseline as possible, and then adjust from there to fit their preferences.</p> \n<p>In addition to adjusting the warm light, the Kindle Colorsoft has vivid mode, which \u201cenhances color in less saturated images.\u201d For the sake of efficacy, most of my time was spent in standard mode when testing the Colorsoft. But in trying out vivid mode, I noticed that its enhanced saturation was most noticeable in warm-toned images: reds appeared ever-so-slightly more striking, while oranges and yellows had a more bronze effect and the like. But I had to turn vivid mode on and off a few times to clock the effect because it\u2019s quite subtle.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the question of actually reading words on the Colorsoft. Even the Kindle team representative I spoke with acknowledged that, due to the extra physical layer in the screen that enables color, one might notice a bit less sharpness and contrast in black-and-white text on the Colorsoft\u2019s screen. That\u2019s not unique to this particular Kindle \u2014 every color ereader will have this issue to some degree.</p> \n<p>When comparing the text-only experience of the Kindle Colorsoft to that of the Kobo Libra Colour, I found both to be quite good and comparable to one another. Where there\u2019s a bigger possibility for discrepancies is in a comparison of the Colorsoft to, say, the new Kindle Paperwhite. I did not have the latter device to compare to, but I did have my personal, previous-generation Paperwhite, and the difference was ever so slight, with the standard Paperwhite having the (small) upper hand in the contrast and sharpness departments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-reading-experience\">Reading experience</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Amazon Kindle Colorsoft\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-10/fdc96100-9609-11ef-8a5b-8d387fab5cb4\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>The color screen is the most consequential thing about the Kindle Colorsoft, and chances are if you\u2019ve had a Kindle in the past, the reading experience on this new device will feel quite familiar. The Kindle UI hasn\u2019t changed much, still dividing the main screen into Home and Library options. The former is basically a space for Amazon to serve you personalized book recommendations and promote new Kindle releases, while the latter shows your entire digital library including books, documents, Audible audiobooks and library loans. The Library page is striking in color and there is something undeniably satisfying about seeing all of your title covers in full-color glory.</p> \n<p>While reading a book, you can still customize and save different themes with fonts, font sizes and page layouts that best suit your preferences. You still have the option to quickly navigate within a title by page, location, chapter and even popular highlights. Page turns are speedy and will likely be an improvement for anyone coming from an older Kindle or other ereader.</p> \n<p>Annotations and your own highlights are collected in the same place for easy reference, and with the latter, you can filter by highlight color as well. You have four colors to choose from on the Colorsoft \u2014 orange, yellow, blue and pink \u2014 so if you use the yellow highlighter to mark favorite quotes, you can then filter by just that color. Note that all highlighting and note-taking must be done with your fingers because, unlike the Kindle Scribe, the Colorsoft has no stylus support.</p> \n<p>The pinch-to-zoom feature on the Colorsoft is good for those who read a lot of graphic novels and comics. Amazon developed a custom algorithm to make this motion as smooth as possible, and it\u2019s a pretty good experience, albeit not a unique one. You can also pinch to zoom on the Kobo Libra Colour, which mostly helps get in closer to comic panels to read small text or better see minute details.</p> \n<p>On both devices, there are full-screen refreshes when you pinch to zoom on color images and the speed of completion is roughly the same. I also found image quality to be quite similar as well, and it\u2019s worth noting that art style can skew your impression of an image\u2019s quality. A comic that employs clean, distinct lines compared to one that\u2019s more grungy and watercolor-like will always come off more crisp.</p> \n<p>The Colorsoft, like the regular Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, also has an auto-adjusting front light that promises to illuminate the display just right depending on if you\u2019re reading outside on a sunny day, in the dark cabin of an airplane or anywhere else. It\u2019s a nice hardware perk to have and, with the feature turned on, removes much of manual fiddling that some might find annoying to do when they take their Kindle into different environments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-competition\">The competition</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Amazon Kindle Colorsoft\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-10/228a40e0-960a-11ef-8f9f-f72dda86ee0f\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>While we already went through the screen comparisons for the $280 Kindle Colorsoft and the $220 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dfe8f791-db19-4bc7-8590-62cf2c461210&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLmtvYm9ib29rcy5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvZXJlYWRlcnMvcHJvZHVjdHMva29iby1saWJyYS1jb2xvdXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmZThmNzkxLWRiMTktNGJjNy04NTkwLTYyY2YyYzQ2MTIxMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91cy5rb2JvYm9va3MuY29tL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25zL2VyZWFkZXJzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2tvYm8tbGlicmEtY29sb3VyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd0_oiaiIMBGZvxp1YQIPEq4Qr4MZ0UixZjvUXXtPBHa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fcollections%2Fereaders%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-libra-colour\">Kobo Libra Colour</a>, there are plenty of other differences between the two that you should consider when picking your next ereader. I\u2019ve added a spec list below to break down the basics, and the most consequential to me are the fact that the Kobo has page-turn buttons and stylus support.</p> \n<p>The former is really a matter of preference \u2014 you either love physical buttons or you find no use for them \u2014 but the latter is pure added value even if you do have to purchase the $70 Kobo stylus separately. It essentially allows you to turn the Libra Colour into a makeshift Kobo Sage or Kindle Scribe, which could be useful for anyone in academia (students and educators alike) or anyone who just loves the feeling of putting pen to \u201cpaper.\u201d Meanwhile, the Kindle has the upper hand in its wireless charging capabilities and its slightly cleaner flush-front design.</p> \n<p>When it comes to actual content available on Kindle and Kobo devices, the libraries you can purchase from on both are vast: both have ebooks and audiobooks available, and both the Colorsoft and Libra Colour support Bluetooth, so you can listen to audiobooks directly from the device with your wireless headphones.

Kobo integrates elegantly with Overdrive, making it nearly seamless to get borrowed books on your ereader. Simply connect your Overdrive account and library card in the settings menu and you can then either browse your library\u2019s offerings directly on device, or use the Libby mobile app to borrow titles and those will appear automatically on your Kobo. My only gripe with this system is that it works best if you have <em>just one</em> library card, since you can only connect one at a time. I\u2019m a unique case where I have at least three library cards and I switch among them in Libby depending on which has the title I\u2019m looking for.</p> \n<p>Those like me might prefer the \u201csend to Kindle\u201d option in Libby, which just takes a couple more clicks to get any book from any library network to your Kindle device. The biggest downside here is that my Colorsoft review unit did not show all of my library book covers in full-color glory on the lock screen. After troubleshooting with a representative from Amazon, it was determined to be a title-specific issue. According to Amazon: \"For library books, the lock screen is taken from the designated marketing cover for the book used by the library, which may not be the same as the actual book cover.\" So just know that if you get most of your reading material from your local library, there's a chance some of the covers may not display properly on the Colorsoft.</p> \n<p>I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dfe8f791-db19-4bc7-8590-62cf2c461210&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvZ29jb2xvcjciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmZThmNzkxLWRiMTktNGJjNy04NTkwLTYyY2YyYzQ2MTIxMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zaG9wLmJvb3guY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2dvY29sb3I3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWXyRflaG-5sIkBGHEZdpncGUhM83JasVG2d7uQu6YyV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fgocolor7\">$250 Boox Go Color 7</a>, which earned a spot in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html\">best ereaders</a> guide after my colleague Amy Skorheim tested it. First, it\u2019s imperative to know that Boox devices require a bit more tech-savvy than a Kindle or a Kobo, as well as a willingness to experiment. They are full-blown <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-android-tablet-120007530.html\">Android tablets</a> after all, and that might be exactly what you\u2019re looking for if you get your reading material from many different sources, since it offers access to the Google Play Store and all of its apps. As for specs, the Go Color 7 has a seven-inch Kaleido 3 display with 300 ppi in black and white and 150 ppi in color (similar to the Colorsoft), along with a warm light, page-turn buttons, a splash-resistant design and 64GB of storage (and a microSD card slot for more space!). It\u2019s even more similar to the Kobo Libra Colour in feature set and price, so it\u2019s another option for anyone willing to think a bit outside the standard ereader box.</p> \n<p>The decision between Kindle, Kobo and Boox is infinitely more complicated than choosing between the Colorsoft or the standard Kindle Paperwhite \u2014 and that\u2019s precisely because of the stark price difference. The Colorsoft is $120 more than the regular Kindle Paperwhite ($100 more if you pay to remove the lock screen ads from the Paperwhite, and $80 more than the Signature Edition) and aside from the color panel, it only adds wireless charging, the auto-adjusting front light sensor and doubles the storage. Remove color from the equation, and arguably the most useful of all of those is the extra storage but, make no mistake, 16GB of space on the Kindle Paperwhite is nothing to scoff at and will be just fine for most people. Unless you\u2019re 100-percent certain that color will make a huge difference in your day-to-day reading experience, the standard Paperwhite is the better value.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Amazon Kindle Colorsoft\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-10/3af3f2c0-960a-11ef-bddb-960e28eb0ccd\" style=\"height: 1205px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>While it\u2019s very late to the color E Ink party, the Kindle Colorsoft is a solid premium ereader that provides an excellent experience both in color and black and white. I focused a lot on comparisons in this review because most people will not have the opportunity to have the Colorsoft and any of its contemporaries side by side (unless you\u2019re my dad, who buys almost every ereader and small tablet under the sun). But to be clear, the Colorsoft is a good Kindle, and in many ways, Amazon did pull an Apple here. If you\u2019re already heavily entrenched in the Kindle ecosystem and have been holding out for a color ereader, this is the device to get \u2014 just be prepared to pay a premium for it.</p> \n<p>Also, like Apple and its various operating systems, there\u2019s something to be said about the convenience and ubiquity of the Kindle ecosystem. The library is seemingly endless (with discounts galore), supplemented by Prime Reading and Kindle Unlimited, so it\u2019s easy to get sucked in when you\u2019re already shopping on Amazon for household goods and holiday gifts. But when it comes to value for your money (and a pure spec breakdown), you can get more from Kobo and Boox devices. Kindle isn\u2019t the only name in town anymore for ereaders, and it hasn\u2019t been for a long time, and that seems to be a more pronounced fact now with the introduction of the Colorsoft. If nothing else, Amazon has finally filled a glaring hole in its ereader lineup with this device.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-amazon-kindle-colorsoft-vs-the-competition\">Amazon Kindle Colorsoft vs. the competition</h2> \n<table>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td></td>\n   <td><p><strong>Amazon Kindle Colorsoft</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p><strong>Kobo Libra Colour</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p><strong>Boox Go Color 7</strong></p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Price</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>$280</p> </td>\n   <td><p>$220</p> </td>\n   <td><p>$250</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Display size</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>7-inch color E Ink Kalaido 3 (with custom display stack)</p> </td>\n   <td><p>7-inch color E Ink Kalaido 3</p> </td>\n   <td><p>7-inch color E Ink Kalaido 3</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Pixel density</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>300 ppi (black-and-white), 150 ppi (color content)</p> </td>\n   <td><p>300 ppi (black-and-white), 150 ppi (color content)</p> </td>\n   <td><p>300 ppi (black-and-white), 150 ppi (color content)</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Storage</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>32GB</p> </td>\n   <td><p>32GB</p> </td>\n   <td><p>64GB</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Battery life</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Up to 8 weeks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Up to 6 weeks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>2,300 mAh capacity; \"long-lasting\" battery life</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Page-turn buttons</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Adjustable warm light</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Auto brightness adjustments</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Auto warm light adjustments</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Waterproof rating</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>IPX8</p> </td>\n   <td><p>IPX8</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Not provided</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Pinch-to-zoom support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Not provided</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Stylus support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Audiobook support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, Audible audiobooks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, Kobo audiobooks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via Android apps</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Library support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via Overdrive's \"Send to Kindle\" option</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via built-in Overdrive integration</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via Android apps</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Wireless charging</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>USB-C charging</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html?src=rss",

The company\u2019s ereaders have dominated this space since the original Kindle came out 17 years ago, but in this case, it feels like Amazon is playing catch-up. Color E Ink displays aren\u2019t novel: we\u2019ve tested and reviewed a number of color <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html\">ereaders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a> from Kobo, Boox and reMarkable in recent years. But Amazon is essentially trying to pull an Apple with the Colorsoft: with claims that color E Ink technology just wasn\u2019t good enough to put into a Kindle until now, Amazon\u2019s promising the Colorsoft gets this implementation right thanks in part to the custom tweaks it made to the display. And, unsurprisingly, Amazon\u2019s ready to charge you a premium for it. So is it all it\u2019s cracked up to be? As you might suspect, the answer isn\u2019t as simple as yes or no.</p> \n<p><strong>Update 1/16/25: </strong>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286289/kindle-colorsoft-yellow-bar-display-e-reader\">multiple reports</a> of Kindle Colorsoft owners seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader\u2019s display (myself included), I reached out to Amazon to receive a new review unit. I did so after the company stated publicly that it would make \u201c<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-will-fix-the-kindle-colorsofts-yellow-display-discoloration-190143346.html\">appropriate adjustments</a>\u201d to resolve the issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Amazon sent me a second Colorsoft review unit at the end of 2024 and, in short, the new one did not have the yellow-band issue and the display appeared warmer overall. An Amazon spokesperson told me that a combination of \u201csoftware and display adjustments\u201d was implemented to fix the yellow-band issue, and those are the only differences between my original review unit\u2019s display and that of the new one.</p> \n<p>The difference in warmth between the Kobo Libra Colour\u2019s screen and the Kindle Colorsoft\u2019s screen was dramatically reduced on my second review unit. That\u2019s a good thing for the Colorsoft because its screen now better mimics the look of actual, physical book pages. I've adjusted our pros and cons list to reflect my experience with the new review unit, and what follows is our original review.</p> \n<p><strong>Update 11/5/24: </strong>There have been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286289/kindle-colorsoft-yellow-bar-display-e-reader\">multiple reports</a> of Kindle Colorsoft owners seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader\u2019s display. My review unit was not affected during the time I spent testing the Colorsoft, but upon checking on the morning of November 4, 2024, it appeared for me, too. Upon reaching out to Amazon for comment, a spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously \u2014 customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we\u2019re making the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/amazon-will-fix-the-kindle-colorsofts-yellow-display-discoloration-190143346.html\">appropriate adjustments</a> to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\" In the meantime, we've removed our score and recommended labeling until we're able to get a replacement Colorsoft and test it for a longer period of time to ensure this issue has been fully resolved.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-screen-technology-and-comparisons\">Screen technology and comparisons</h2> \n<p>Let\u2019s get the tech details squared away first. The Kindle Colorsoft\u2019s seven-inch screen is based on <a href=\"https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido3\">E Ink Kaleido 3</a> technology, but a representative from the Kindle team explained to me that they developed a custom display stack for this device. That means they made quite a few changes to the tech in order to achieve things like higher-contrast pigments and improved speeds overall. The Colorsoft\u2019s custom oxide backplane uses 24 driving volts to move pigments around more quickly and it helps those pigments appear with better contrast. Nitride LEDs enhance colors and brightness, and a custom coating in between the display\u2019s layers helps focus light through each pigment so there\u2019s less color mixing. Some of the same tech helps make page-turns quicker and supposedly reduces excessively noticeable screen refreshing when you go from one color page to another, or pinch-and-zoom on an image.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>That\u2019s all to say that Amazon would like you to believe that this E Ink Kaleido 3 screen is not like the other girls in this space, and while I do not doubt the Kindle team\u2019s efforts, the differences are not as dramatic as the story would suggest. Until Kobo updates the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kobos-new-260-sage-e-reader-lets-you-take-notes-110559289.html\">Sage</a> with color, the closest competitor to the $280 Kindle Colorsoft is the $220 Kobo Libra Colour (in size, platform and overall experience), so I did a lot of side-by-side comparisons of the two.</p> \n<p>The biggest difference I saw was that the Kobo\u2019s screen skews warmer than the Kindle\u2019s; I kicked the brightness up to the maximum and turned all warm/natural light settings down to zero on both devices and the difference was noticeable, regardless of if the displays were showing color images, black-and-white text or a mix of the two. This would suggest that the Kindle will show more accurate colors more often since there\u2019s less of a warm lean to its display.</p> \n<p>But on the flip side, the Kindle screen\u2019s blue tint was just as noticeable, particularly in low-light situations (like a dark office or a dimly lit living room). At max brightness with warmth down to zero, the Kindle\u2019s screen was borderline uncomfortable to read in those environments \u2014 but all it took was a slight adjustment to warmth level four (out of 24) to get it to match the Kobo\u2019s display in warmth almost exactly (at least to my eyes). That made it more comfortable to stare at in dark spaces. I also compared the Colorsoft\u2019s screen to my personal Kindle Paperwhite (previous generation) and the blue skew was noticeable there too.</p>  \n<p>Ultimately, how much warm or cool light you prefer while reading is up to personal taste. My preferences would lead me to adjust the warmth on the Kindle to be a bit higher than zero, mimicking that of the Kobo. In an unscientific poll of the Engadget staff, both in person and with device photos, everybody preferred the screen on the Kobo. I think the slight added warmth in Kobo\u2019s screen makes colors appear a bit more saturated and more inviting overall. It also gets close to mimicking the look of actual physical pages (as much as one of these devices could, at least), and that\u2019s the experience I\u2019m going for when I read pretty much anything. But I could understand why some hardcore comic fans would want to start off with the most color-accurate baseline as possible, and then adjust from there to fit their preferences.</p> \n<p>In addition to adjusting the warm light, the Kindle Colorsoft has vivid mode, which \u201cenhances color in less saturated images.\u201d For the sake of efficacy, most of my time was spent in standard mode when testing the Colorsoft. But in trying out vivid mode, I noticed that its enhanced saturation was most noticeable in warm-toned images: reds appeared ever-so-slightly more striking, while oranges and yellows had a more bronze effect and the like. But I had to turn vivid mode on and off a few times to clock the effect because it\u2019s quite subtle.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the question of actually reading words on the Colorsoft. Even the Kindle team representative I spoke with acknowledged that, due to the extra physical layer in the screen that enables color, one might notice a bit less sharpness and contrast in black-and-white text on the Colorsoft\u2019s screen. That\u2019s not unique to this particular Kindle \u2014 every color ereader will have this issue to some degree.</p> \n<p>When comparing the text-only experience of the Kindle Colorsoft to that of the Kobo Libra Colour, I found both to be quite good and comparable to one another. Where there\u2019s a bigger possibility for discrepancies is in a comparison of the Colorsoft to, say, the new Kindle Paperwhite. I did not have the latter device to compare to, but I did have my personal, previous-generation Paperwhite, and the difference was ever so slight, with the standard Paperwhite having the (small) upper hand in the contrast and sharpness departments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-reading-experience\">Reading experience</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Amazon Kindle Colorsoft\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-10/fdc96100-9609-11ef-8a5b-8d387fab5cb4\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>The color screen is the most consequential thing about the Kindle Colorsoft, and chances are if you\u2019ve had a Kindle in the past, the reading experience on this new device will feel quite familiar. The Kindle UI hasn\u2019t changed much, still dividing the main screen into Home and Library options. The former is basically a space for Amazon to serve you personalized book recommendations and promote new Kindle releases, while the latter shows your entire digital library including books, documents, Audible audiobooks and library loans. The Library page is striking in color and there is something undeniably satisfying about seeing all of your title covers in full-color glory.</p> \n<p>While reading a book, you can still customize and save different themes with fonts, font sizes and page layouts that best suit your preferences. You still have the option to quickly navigate within a title by page, location, chapter and even popular highlights. Page turns are speedy and will likely be an improvement for anyone coming from an older Kindle or other ereader.</p> \n<p>Annotations and your own highlights are collected in the same place for easy reference, and with the latter, you can filter by highlight color as well. You have four colors to choose from on the Colorsoft \u2014 orange, yellow, blue and pink \u2014 so if you use the yellow highlighter to mark favorite quotes, you can then filter by just that color. Note that all highlighting and note-taking must be done with your fingers because, unlike the Kindle Scribe, the Colorsoft has no stylus support.</p> \n<p>The pinch-to-zoom feature on the Colorsoft is good for those who read a lot of graphic novels and comics. Amazon developed a custom algorithm to make this motion as smooth as possible, and it\u2019s a pretty good experience, albeit not a unique one. You can also pinch to zoom on the Kobo Libra Colour, which mostly helps get in closer to comic panels to read small text or better see minute details.</p> \n<p>On both devices, there are full-screen refreshes when you pinch to zoom on color images and the speed of completion is roughly the same. I also found image quality to be quite similar as well, and it\u2019s worth noting that art style can skew your impression of an image\u2019s quality. A comic that employs clean, distinct lines compared to one that\u2019s more grungy and watercolor-like will always come off more crisp.</p> \n<p>The Colorsoft, like the regular Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, also has an auto-adjusting front light that promises to illuminate the display just right depending on if you\u2019re reading outside on a sunny day, in the dark cabin of an airplane or anywhere else. It\u2019s a nice hardware perk to have and, with the feature turned on, removes much of manual fiddling that some might find annoying to do when they take their Kindle into different environments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-competition\">The competition</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Amazon Kindle Colorsoft\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-10/228a40e0-960a-11ef-8f9f-f72dda86ee0f\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>While we already went through the screen comparisons for the $280 Kindle Colorsoft and the $220 <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dfe8f791-db19-4bc7-8590-62cf2c461210&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLmtvYm9ib29rcy5jb20vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvZXJlYWRlcnMvcHJvZHVjdHMva29iby1saWJyYS1jb2xvdXIiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmZThmNzkxLWRiMTktNGJjNy04NTkwLTYyY2YyYzQ2MTIxMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91cy5rb2JvYm9va3MuY29tL2NvbGxlY3Rpb25zL2VyZWFkZXJzL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2tvYm8tbGlicmEtY29sb3VyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAd0_oiaiIMBGZvxp1YQIPEq4Qr4MZ0UixZjvUXXtPBHa&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fcollections%2Fereaders%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-libra-colour\">Kobo Libra Colour</a>, there are plenty of other differences between the two that you should consider when picking your next ereader. I\u2019ve added a spec list below to break down the basics, and the most consequential to me are the fact that the Kobo has page-turn buttons and stylus support.</p> \n<p>The former is really a matter of preference \u2014 you either love physical buttons or you find no use for them \u2014 but the latter is pure added value even if you do have to purchase the $70 Kobo stylus separately. It essentially allows you to turn the Libra Colour into a makeshift Kobo Sage or Kindle Scribe, which could be useful for anyone in academia (students and educators alike) or anyone who just loves the feeling of putting pen to \u201cpaper.\u201d Meanwhile, the Kindle has the upper hand in its wireless charging capabilities and its slightly cleaner flush-front design.</p> \n<p>When it comes to actual content available on Kindle and Kobo devices, the libraries you can purchase from on both are vast: both have ebooks and audiobooks available, and both the Colorsoft and Libra Colour support Bluetooth, so you can listen to audiobooks directly from the device with your wireless headphones.

Kobo integrates elegantly with Overdrive, making it nearly seamless to get borrowed books on your ereader. Simply connect your Overdrive account and library card in the settings menu and you can then either browse your library\u2019s offerings directly on device, or use the Libby mobile app to borrow titles and those will appear automatically on your Kobo. My only gripe with this system is that it works best if you have <em>just one</em> library card, since you can only connect one at a time. I\u2019m a unique case where I have at least three library cards and I switch among them in Libby depending on which has the title I\u2019m looking for.</p> \n<p>Those like me might prefer the \u201csend to Kindle\u201d option in Libby, which just takes a couple more clicks to get any book from any library network to your Kindle device. The biggest downside here is that my Colorsoft review unit did not show all of my library book covers in full-color glory on the lock screen. After troubleshooting with a representative from Amazon, it was determined to be a title-specific issue. According to Amazon: \"For library books, the lock screen is taken from the designated marketing cover for the book used by the library, which may not be the same as the actual book cover.\" So just know that if you get most of your reading material from your local library, there's a chance some of the covers may not display properly on the Colorsoft.</p> \n<p>I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=dfe8f791-db19-4bc7-8590-62cf2c461210&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvZ29jb2xvcjciLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImRmZThmNzkxLWRiMTktNGJjNy04NTkwLTYyY2YyYzQ2MTIxMCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zaG9wLmJvb3guY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2dvY29sb3I3In0&amp;signature=AQAAAWXyRflaG-5sIkBGHEZdpncGUhM83JasVG2d7uQu6YyV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fgocolor7\">$250 Boox Go Color 7</a>, which earned a spot in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-ereader-130013808.html\">best ereaders</a> guide after my colleague Amy Skorheim tested it. First, it\u2019s imperative to know that Boox devices require a bit more tech-savvy than a Kindle or a Kobo, as well as a willingness to experiment. They are full-blown <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-android-tablet-120007530.html\">Android tablets</a> after all, and that might be exactly what you\u2019re looking for if you get your reading material from many different sources, since it offers access to the Google Play Store and all of its apps. As for specs, the Go Color 7 has a seven-inch Kaleido 3 display with 300 ppi in black and white and 150 ppi in color (similar to the Colorsoft), along with a warm light, page-turn buttons, a splash-resistant design and 64GB of storage (and a microSD card slot for more space!). It\u2019s even more similar to the Kobo Libra Colour in feature set and price, so it\u2019s another option for anyone willing to think a bit outside the standard ereader box.</p> \n<p>The decision between Kindle, Kobo and Boox is infinitely more complicated than choosing between the Colorsoft or the standard Kindle Paperwhite \u2014 and that\u2019s precisely because of the stark price difference. The Colorsoft is $120 more than the regular Kindle Paperwhite ($100 more if you pay to remove the lock screen ads from the Paperwhite, and $80 more than the Signature Edition) and aside from the color panel, it only adds wireless charging, the auto-adjusting front light sensor and doubles the storage. Remove color from the equation, and arguably the most useful of all of those is the extra storage but, make no mistake, 16GB of space on the Kindle Paperwhite is nothing to scoff at and will be just fine for most people. Unless you\u2019re 100-percent certain that color will make a huge difference in your day-to-day reading experience, the standard Paperwhite is the better value.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Amazon Kindle Colorsoft\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-10/3af3f2c0-960a-11ef-bddb-960e28eb0ccd\" style=\"height: 1205px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Valentina Palladino / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>While it\u2019s very late to the color E Ink party, the Kindle Colorsoft is a solid premium ereader that provides an excellent experience both in color and black and white. I focused a lot on comparisons in this review because most people will not have the opportunity to have the Colorsoft and any of its contemporaries side by side (unless you\u2019re my dad, who buys almost every ereader and small tablet under the sun). But to be clear, the Colorsoft is a good Kindle, and in many ways, Amazon did pull an Apple here. If you\u2019re already heavily entrenched in the Kindle ecosystem and have been holding out for a color ereader, this is the device to get \u2014 just be prepared to pay a premium for it.</p> \n<p>Also, like Apple and its various operating systems, there\u2019s something to be said about the convenience and ubiquity of the Kindle ecosystem. The library is seemingly endless (with discounts galore), supplemented by Prime Reading and Kindle Unlimited, so it\u2019s easy to get sucked in when you\u2019re already shopping on Amazon for household goods and holiday gifts. But when it comes to value for your money (and a pure spec breakdown), you can get more from Kobo and Boox devices. Kindle isn\u2019t the only name in town anymore for ereaders, and it hasn\u2019t been for a long time, and that seems to be a more pronounced fact now with the introduction of the Colorsoft. If nothing else, Amazon has finally filled a glaring hole in its ereader lineup with this device.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-amazon-kindle-colorsoft-vs-the-competition\">Amazon Kindle Colorsoft vs. the competition</h2> \n<table>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td></td>\n   <td><p><strong>Amazon Kindle Colorsoft</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p><strong>Kobo Libra Colour</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p><strong>Boox Go Color 7</strong></p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Price</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>$280</p> </td>\n   <td><p>$220</p> </td>\n   <td><p>$250</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Display size</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>7-inch color E Ink Kalaido 3 (with custom display stack)</p> </td>\n   <td><p>7-inch color E Ink Kalaido 3</p> </td>\n   <td><p>7-inch color E Ink Kalaido 3</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Pixel density</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>300 ppi (black-and-white), 150 ppi (color content)</p> </td>\n   <td><p>300 ppi (black-and-white), 150 ppi (color content)</p> </td>\n   <td><p>300 ppi (black-and-white), 150 ppi (color content)</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Storage</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>32GB</p> </td>\n   <td><p>32GB</p> </td>\n   <td><p>64GB</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Battery life</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Up to 8 weeks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Up to 6 weeks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>2,300 mAh capacity; \"long-lasting\" battery life</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Page-turn buttons</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Adjustable warm light</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Auto brightness adjustments</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Auto warm light adjustments</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Waterproof rating</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>IPX8</p> </td>\n   <td><p>IPX8</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Not provided</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Pinch-to-zoom support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Not provided</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Stylus support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Audiobook support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, Audible audiobooks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, Kobo audiobooks</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via Android apps</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Library support</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via Overdrive's \"Send to Kindle\" option</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via built-in Overdrive integration</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes, via Android apps</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Wireless charging</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n   <td><p>No</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>USB-C charging</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><p><strong>Bluetooth</strong></p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n   <td><p>Yes</p> </td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html?src=rss",

In the first category, the competition is really between Amazon\u2019s Kindle devices and Rakuten\u2019s Kobo readers. Ereaders in the latter group include entries from Onyx Boox, PocketBook and a couple of smaller companies. <br /><br />Of course, any smartphone or tablet can act as an ereader, but for our purposes, we focused on devices with paper-like, E Ink screens.

Here are the best ereaders you can buy, with picks based on more than a year of testing.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">Best ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-to-get-books-for-your-ereader\">How to get books for your ereader</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-we-test-ereaders\">How we test ereaders</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-ebook-readers-for-2025\">The best ebook readers for 2025</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-ereader\">What to look for in an ereader</h2> \n<p>Plenty of apps, including the Kindle app, will let you download and read digital books on a phone or tablet. But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Color ereaders add a <a href=\"https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido\">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen \u2014 the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> \n<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most ereaders to do a number of things well. They\u2019ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we\u2019re talking weeks, not days.</p> \n<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading-features\"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> \n<p>With any ereader, you\u2019ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> \n<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved \u2013 even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don\u2019t recommend them.</p> \n<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you\u2019re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-other-features\"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> \n<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html\">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen\u2019s frame rate can\u2019t handle gaming, but it\u2019s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver\u2019s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> \n<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> \n<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html\">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"An assortment of ereaders, including ones from Kobo, Kindle, Boox, Nook and PocketBook are arranged on a tan bamboo desk with a white keyboard and black mouse in the background. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c06d4490-cf16-11ed-96e7-3cba2c2f1226\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-get-books-for-your-ereader\">How to get books for your ereader</h2> \n<p>Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand\u2019s devices.

It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don\u2019t want to be locked into one brand\u2019s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-upload-epubs-onto-an-ereader\"><strong>How to upload ePubs onto an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Stores like <a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/\">ebooks.com</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books?hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Google Play</a> have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don\u2019t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party apps (of which there are many) to ready those files.</p> \n<p>Titles from some publishers like <a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/publisher/tor-publishing-group/207044153?_c=1\">Tor</a> and public domain classics from sites like <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">Project Gutenberg</a> are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader <em>do</em> support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.</p> \n<p>To do so, you\u2019ll typically need a computer running a free program called <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3NvbHV0aW9ucy9lYm9vay9kaWdpdGFsLWVkaXRpb25zL2Rvd25sb2FkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYfVa2G0Z86CjcQZkqWy4CaRDfMi0aF2N0kUMd-_t-hK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html\">Adobe Digital Editions</a> (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you\u2019ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlbHB4LmFkb2JlLmNvbS9tYW5hZ2UtYWNjb3VudC91c2luZy9jcmVhdGUtdXBkYXRlLWFkb2JlLWlkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWxweC5hZG9iZS5jb20vbWFuYWdlLWFjY291bnQvdXNpbmcvY3JlYXRlLXVwZGF0ZS1hZG9iZS1pZC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAe1FmisAa8XGIvkkTl5PDnkcDwNZclFfu47-GV95Mtev&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhelpx.adobe.com%2Fmanage-account%2Fusing%2Fcreate-update-adobe-id.html\">Adobe ID</a>. Once you\u2019ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.</p> \n<p>Kindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3NlbmR0b2tpbmRsZT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc2VuZHRva2luZGxlIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS5ZVsNxdCVtDYx5iNTxXHLeRX1mGBWg9NRQRPJNtX_j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fsendtokindle\">Send to Kindle</a> page open. As long as you\u2019re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.</p> \n<p>Boox also uses a browser uploader called <a href=\"https://push.boox.com/#/push/file\">BooxDrop</a> (along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKZ0_NBysfk\">many other methods</a>) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you\u2019ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox\u2019s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn\u2019t support files with DRM, so you won\u2019t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-read-library-books-on-an-ereader\"><strong>How to read library books on an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html\">Overdrive</a> and its companion app <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby\">Libby</a>. On a <a href=\"https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader\">Kobo</a>, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you\u2019ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo\u2019s home screen once the device syncs.</p> \n<p>To read library books on a <a href=\"https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html\">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library\u2019s website. Once you click Borrow, you\u2019ll see the option to \u201cRead now with Kindle,\u201d which takes you to Amazon\u2019s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> \n<p>For other ereaders, you\u2019ll go through your library\u2019s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> \n<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won\u2019t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Four ereaders are arranged on a dark brown wooden table outside.

Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p> \n<p>Over the course of the past year and a half, I\u2019ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months.

href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html\">Amazon\u2019s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it\u2019s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> \n<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader\u2019s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously\u2014customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we\u2019re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"</p> \n<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It\u2019s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that\u2019s a good thing.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books\"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon\u2019s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library \u2014 the same way you\u2019d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle\"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> \n<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon\u2019s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon\u2019s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can\u2019t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-kindle-and-kobo\"><strong>What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?</strong></h3> \n<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> \n<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store.

Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient \u201cread on Kindle\u201d function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>January 2025: </strong>Updated the \"Others we tested\" section to include impressions of the second Kindle Colorsoft review unit we received.</p> \n<p><strong>August 2024</strong>: Replaced our Android tablet pick with the new Go Color 7 ereader from Boox.

That issue emerged on our review unit as well. Amazon offered refunds or replacements for affected devices.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The company sent us a second review unit on which the yellow band wasn't present. The display seemed warmer in general too, which makes it look more like physical book pages.

The Kindle Colorsoft will run for up to eight weeks on a single charge and you can top up the battery wirelessly or via USB-C.</p> \n<p>The ereader has an IPX8 rating. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=79738062-a1a8-41f2-a6cf-0f2fa846f06b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL2Jyb3dzZS5odG1sP25vZGU9MTgxMTY2NzAwMTEmdGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNzk3MzgwNjItYTFhOC00MWYyLWE2Y2YtMGYyZmE4NDZmMDZiIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL2Jyb3dzZS5odG1sP25vZGU9MTgxMTY2NzAwMTEiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUytW1ZCX4iihYwyjyV30FeBO1FwjrvJaiUCgvwjI43m&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fbrowse.html%3Fnode%3D18116670011\"><ins>That means</ins></a> it can withstand immersion in up to two meters of freshwater for up to 60 minutes and 0.25 meters of seawater for three minutes, according to Amazon.

The auto-adjusting front light is handy too.

In the first category, the competition is really between Amazon\u2019s Kindle devices and Rakuten\u2019s Kobo readers. Ereaders in the latter group include entries from Onyx Boox, PocketBook and a couple of smaller companies. <br /><br />Of course, any smartphone or tablet can act as an ereader, but for our purposes, we focused on devices with paper-like, E Ink screens.

But what makes ebook readers different is the screen: nearly all of them use technology from a company called E Ink. It manufactures electronic paper displays (EPD) composed of three sheets: one containing millions of microcapsules filled with black and white ink particles sandwiched between transparent electrode layers. When a charge is applied, either the black or white particles shift to the top, forming letters and the whitespace around them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Color ereaders add a <a href=\"https://www.eink.com/brand/detail/Kaleido\">color filter array</a> on top of the standard black and white microcapsule layer. The result is two different resolutions on one screen \u2014 the color clarity is 150 dpi while black and white images and text are still 300 dpi.</p> \n<p>Because these displays are so different from standard backlight LED panels, you can expect most ereaders to do a number of things well. They\u2019ll be easier to stare at for long periods of time and easier to read in direct sunlight. Also, since E Ink displays only require power to rearrange the ink, these devices have much longer battery lives than even the best tablets: we\u2019re talking weeks, not days.</p> \n<p>The ereader market is not as saturated as, say, the smartphone market, but there are still plenty of options out there and they do have small but important differences among them. They tend to range from around $100 to more than $400, though usually the higher end options are stylus-enabled read/write <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html\">E Ink tablets</a> like the Kindle Scribe. Beyond price, you should consider physical properties like buttons, lights, storage and resolution, as well as how the software lets you find and access books.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading-features\"><strong>Reading features</strong></h3> \n<p>With any ereader, you\u2019ll navigate the OS via taps and swipes, and some add physical page-turn buttons. Most with built-in buttons have an auto-rotating screen so you can press with your right or left hand.</p> \n<p>As E Ink technology has advanced, resolution has greatly improved \u2013 even the budget Kindle ereader has a 300 ppi display. You can still find models with lower resolution, but we don\u2019t recommend them.</p> \n<p>Some ereaders have front LEDs that support light temperature adjustment. That means you can switch to a warmer light after the sun goes down, which will feel easier on the eyes. If you\u2019re concerned about blue light, you should go for a reader with that feature.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-other-features\"><strong>Other features</strong></h3> \n<p>The capabilities of these pocket libraries have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/kindle-scribe-update-adds-new-brushes-and-better-organization-210011764.html\">advanced</a> considerably since the early days. In addition to storing books, some let you browse the web, run apps and play music. The screen\u2019s frame rate can\u2019t handle gaming, but it\u2019s good enough to show you the Wikipedia entry for Striver\u2019s Row while you read <em>Crook Manifesto</em>.</p> \n<p>If you listen to audiobooks, you may want a Bluetooth-enabled ereader capable of playing them. Most of the models we tested have that ability, with the notable exception of the Nook ereader we tried. Keep in mind that audiobook files can take up more space than print files so you'll probably want a device with a higher storage capacity if you plan on doing a lot of listening.</p> \n<p>Above all, you should consider where and how you intend to find books to read. Most ereaders make it easiest to shop through their own digital bookstores, but all of them (even <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-supports-epub-format-002501848.html\">Kindles</a>) will now let you download titles from other sources, like libraries, unaffiliated ebook sellers and free public domain sites.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"An assortment of ereaders, including ones from Kobo, Kindle, Boox, Nook and PocketBook are arranged on a tan bamboo desk with a white keyboard and black mouse in the background. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/c06d4490-cf16-11ed-96e7-3cba2c2f1226\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Amy Skorheim / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-get-books-for-your-ereader\">How to get books for your ereader</h2> \n<p>Kindle, Nook and Kobo all have their own stores that you access directly from each brand\u2019s devices.

It also syncs your reading across devices and apps, so you can pick up where you left off on your phone if you forgot your ereader at home. It truly is the most convenient way to go, but if you don\u2019t want to be locked into one brand\u2019s store, or if you opt for an ereader without its own marketplace, you do have options.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-upload-epubs-onto-an-ereader\"><strong>How to upload ePubs onto an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Stores like <a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/\">ebooks.com</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/books?hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Google Play</a> have millions of ebooks for sale as digital rights-managed (DRM) ePub files, which Kobo, Nook and PocketBook readers can read in their native ereader apps. Kindles don\u2019t support DRM ePub files at all and Boox devices require third party apps (of which there are many) to ready those files.</p> \n<p>Titles from some publishers like <a href=\"https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/publisher/tor-publishing-group/207044153?_c=1\">Tor</a> and public domain classics from sites like <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">Project Gutenberg</a> are also sold as ePubs, but without the added DRM. Consequently, Kindles and the Boox Neoreader <em>do</em> support those files. Books you get from third-party sources will look just like ones you bought from a proprietary store, thanks to the flowable, formatted nature of ePub files. While these device-agnostic ebook collections give you extra options for finding your next read, they require a few additional steps to get the files onto your ereader.</p> \n<p>To do so, you\u2019ll typically need a computer running a free program called <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=7247b01c-2a32-4141-aac1-4e4bb8170ec0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rite+Aid&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI3MjQ3YjAxYy0yYTMyLTQxNDEtYWFjMS00ZTRiYjgxNzBlYzAiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWRvYmUuY29tL3NvbHV0aW9ucy9lYm9vay9kaWdpdGFsLWVkaXRpb25zL2Rvd25sb2FkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYfVa2G0Z86CjcQZkqWy4CaRDfMi0aF2N0kUMd-_t-hK&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fsolutions%2Febook%2Fdigital-editions%2Fdownload.html\">Adobe Digital Editions</a> (ADE). After buying and downloading the ePub file, open ADE and plug your ereader into your computer (all readers here have a USB-C port for charging and data transfers). Your device should pop up in the left panel. Drag and drop the ePub file from your downloads folder into the main panel in ADE. The file will display as an image of the book cover. Drag that image onto your device on the left panel. If the file includes digital rights management (which protects against unauthorized copying) you\u2019ll need to authorize your ereader, which requires using or creating a free <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hlbHB4LmFkb2JlLmNvbS9tYW5hZ2UtYWNjb3VudC91c2luZy9jcmVhdGUtdXBkYXRlLWFkb2JlLWlkLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWxweC5hZG9iZS5jb20vbWFuYWdlLWFjY291bnQvdXNpbmcvY3JlYXRlLXVwZGF0ZS1hZG9iZS1pZC5odG1sIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAe1FmisAa8XGIvkkTl5PDnkcDwNZclFfu47-GV95Mtev&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fhelpx.adobe.com%2Fmanage-account%2Fusing%2Fcreate-update-adobe-id.html\">Adobe ID</a>. Once you\u2019ve finished adding files to upload, eject the reader from your computer to complete the transfer process.</p> \n<p>Kindles use a web-based uploader instead of the ADE method. But since Kindle uses its own proprietary DRM technology instead of Adobe's, the only files it can accept from third parties are non-DRM files, such as from Tor Publishing or Project Gutenberg. After downloading a compatible ePub file, drag and drop it into your browser with the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3NlbmR0b2tpbmRsZT90YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vc2VuZHRva2luZGxlIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAS5ZVsNxdCVtDYx5iNTxXHLeRX1mGBWg9NRQRPJNtX_j&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fsendtokindle\">Send to Kindle</a> page open. As long as you\u2019re signed into Amazon, this wirelessly transfers the files to your associated device.</p> \n<p>Boox also uses a browser uploader called <a href=\"https://push.boox.com/#/push/file\">BooxDrop</a> (along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKZ0_NBysfk\">many other methods</a>) to deliver ePubs to the device. Open it from the Boox App menu and you\u2019ll see a device-specific url. Type that into your browser to access a file delivery portal that uploads to your library. Boox\u2019s built-in ereader app, NeoReader, also doesn\u2019t support files with DRM, so you won\u2019t be able to read current titles from most publishers using that app. Fortunately, Boox devices run nearly every ereader app out there, Kobo and Kindle included, letting you access ePubs any number of ways.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-read-library-books-on-an-ereader\"><strong>How to read library books on an ereader</strong></h3> \n<p>Your local library card lets you borrow audio and ebooks through a program called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/e-book-library-app-overdrive-is-shutting-down-on-may-1st-194807737.html\">Overdrive</a> and its companion app <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby\">Libby</a>. On a <a href=\"https://help.kobo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017677053-Borrow-eBooks-from-the-public-library-using-your-Kobo-eReader\">Kobo</a>, you have have built-in access to Overdrive in a separate tab. Once you\u2019ve linked your public library card, the search function will include results for titles available from your local library; a few taps will upload your selections to your device for the length of the loan. I personally find it easiest to borrow the title I want through the Libby app on my phone. After that, the book pops up on my Kobo\u2019s home screen once the device syncs.</p> \n<p>To read library books on a <a href=\"https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0431.html\">Kindle</a>, you can either go through the Libby app or the Overdrive section of your library\u2019s website. Once you click Borrow, you\u2019ll see the option to \u201cRead now with Kindle,\u201d which takes you to Amazon\u2019s site to sign in. After that, the book will be delivered to your device the next time it connects to WiFi.</p> \n<p>For other ereaders, you\u2019ll go through your library\u2019s Overdrive portal and download the ePub after clicking the Borrow button. You can then use the ADE process we described above. Devices that run external apps, like Boox's Page, Go Color 7 or Palma, allow you to read library books via the Libby app, just as you would on a smartphone or iPad.</p> \n<p>You can also use the Libby app to borrow audiobooks, but you won\u2019t be able to access them through your ereader. (The exception is an ereader, like a Boox device, that allows external apps). I found it was easier to listen to an audiobook on my phone anyway, regardless of whether I borrowed it through Libby or bought it from Kindle or Kobo.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Four ereaders are arranged on a dark brown wooden table outside.

We look at what\u2019s available, what\u2019s new, and what shoppers and professional reviewers have to say. Then we narrow a list to the best candidates for hands-on testing.</p> \n<p>Over the course of the past year and a half, I\u2019ve tested just over a dozen ereaders, representing five different brands: Amazon, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble, Boox and PocketBook. I bought, borrowed and uploaded books for each device using the methods above. I used each one for between a few days to a few months. I evaluated each one in the areas of book access, ease of reading, extra features and overall value.

href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/kindle-colorsoft-review-the-missing-link-in-amazons-ereader-lineup-131529685.html\">Amazon\u2019s first color Kindle</a> impressed with its quick page-turns and load times, auto-adjusting front light and, of course, a decently striking color E Ink display. But at $280, it\u2019s more expensive than all of the other color ereaders in its size range, including the Kobo Libra Colour and the Boox Go Color 7.</p> \n<p>Also, some Colorsoft owners reported seeing a yellow band at the bottom of their ereader\u2019s display. This issue did not affect our first review unit during the original testing period, but it eventually appeared. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget: \"A small number of customers have reported a yellow band along the bottom of the display. We take the quality of our products seriously\u2014customers who notice this can reach out to our customer service team for a replacement or refund, and we\u2019re making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that new devices will not experience this issue moving forward.\"</p> \n<p>Amazon sent us a new Colorsoft ereader at the end of 2024 and it does appear that the fixes the company made resolved the yellow-band issue. The screen on our second review unit appears warmer overall, but not overly so. It\u2019s more akin to the screen on the Kobo Libra Colour, and that\u2019s a good thing.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ereader-faqs\">Ereader FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-which-ereaders-can-read-kindle-books\"><strong>Which ereaders can read Kindle books?</strong></h3> \n<p>Amazon\u2019s Kindle ereaders are the obvious answer, but other devices capable of running apps can also read titles from the Kindle store. For example, you can download the Kindle app on a Boox ereader through Google Play (the store comes standard in the Boox app menu). You can then sign into your Kindle account and access all the books in your library \u2014 the same way you\u2019d read Kindle books on your phone or tablet.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-you-buy-kindle-books-without-a-kindle\"><strong>Can you buy Kindle books without a Kindle?</strong></h3> \n<p>Yes. You can buy Kindle books through the Kindle app or through Amazon\u2019s website via a browser. You can read those titles on a Kindle or any device that can run the Kindle app, such as a smartphone, tablet or computer. Just be aware that Kindle titles can <em>only</em> be read through one of Amazon\u2019s ereaders or the Kindle app. The company uses proprietary digital rights management on all ebooks it sells that can\u2019t be read by other ereader apps like Kobo or Adobe ADE.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-kindle-and-kobo\"><strong>What's the difference between Kindle and Kobo?</strong></h3> \n<p>Both Kindle and Kobo are brands of dedicated ereaders that support searching, buying, downloading and reading ebooks from their own stores. Both also support borrowing books from your local library via Overdrive and Libby.</p> \n<p>The difference is that Kindle is owned by Amazon and uses the Kindle store, whereas Kobo is owned by Rakuten and its books come from the Kobo store. Both stores come pre-loaded as a tab on their respective ereader and both carry most in-print books. Each store also carries their own exclusive ebooks as well, but Amazon\u2019s library of <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2I_bm9kZT0xOTI3MTcwNjAxMSZ0YWc9Z2RndDBjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1MWRjY2JjZC1hYzY1LTRmYzAtOTlkMy02ZDljZDM4OWFjYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYj9ub2RlPTE5MjcxNzA2MDExIiwiZHluYW1pY0NlbnRyYWxUcmFja2luZ0lkIjp0cnVlLCJzaXRlSWQiOiJ1cy1lbmdhZGdldCIsInBhZ2VJZCI6IjFwLWF1dG9saW5rIiwiZmVhdHVyZUlkIjoidGV4dC1saW5rIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVfQtILpNl4j-jhmpgChMRVcssUkpbLilOSDy4FrIhd1&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fb%3Fnode%3D19271706011\">Kindle-only books</a> is much larger <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=10b363e1-6abb-4fc0-b019-cb4ff191d49a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=51dccbcd-ac65-4fc0-99d3-6d9cd389acb1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Kobo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2JvLmNvbS91cy9lbi9wL2tvYm9vcmlnaW5hbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjUxZGNjYmNkLWFjNjUtNGZjMC05OWQzLTZkOWNkMzg5YWNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua29iby5jb20vdXMvZW4vcC9rb2Jvb3JpZ2luYWxzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATjuNnZvRXlMJC6dkHZ86gdxoVLQ4PXMnCI_YfD7Ivq4&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kobo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fkobooriginals\">than Kobo\u2019s</a>.

Other ereaders, like Boox, let you borrow books after downloading the Libby App. Only Kobo ereaders let you search for and borrow books directly on the ereader, with a dedicated Overdrive tab. Kindles, on the other hand, utilize a convenient \u201cread on Kindle\u201d function from the Libby app or website. You can send a borrowed book to your Kindle just by signing into your account. Both methods are pretty easy, so which is the best for you probably depends on other factors than just the library-book feature.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>January 2025: </strong>Updated the \"Others we tested\" section to include impressions of the second Kindle Colorsoft review unit we received.</p> \n<p><strong>August 2024</strong>: Replaced our Android tablet pick with the new Go Color 7 ereader from Boox.
