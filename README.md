# Pulse - Financial News Dashboard

A modern, interactive financial news detection and analysis dashboard built with React and D3.js for **Wellershoff & Partners** and **IBM**. This application automatically identifies, summarizes, and prepares financial news for human-in-the-loop review, addressing the critical challenge of monitoring global market-moving events.

## üéØ Problem Statement

W&P analysts and strategists constantly scan global news for events that can move the markets and for news relevant to client portfolios. Upon significant developments, they must make strategic adjustments and communicate to clients. This process is resource-intensive and risks missing critical developments.

## üéØ Project Goal

Develop a prototype that automatically identifies news relevant to financial markets (e.g., Fed decisions, CEO exits, earnings surprises), summarizes them, and prepares them for human-in-the-loop review at W&P before delivery to clients.

## üìä Data Structure

### News Data Format

**Note**: This format was used to achieve fast results due to time constraints at the hackathon. The team collected all data independently and trained their own model, ensuring complete independence from external news frameworks. For productive use, a complete restructuration of the data format is highly recommended for better maintainability and scalability.
```json
{
  "data": {
    "labeldata": [
